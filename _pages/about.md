I am a researcher doing urban climate study in China. 
I used numerical weather predition models in my work, 
but mostly use Python and various packages to do 
my everyday data analysis and plotting for publication. 
I am teaching an undergraduate course about [Python and its application in Atmospheric Sciences](https://smartlixx.github.io/AS213_Python_in_Atmos_Sciences/).
